You'd have to have been snoozing pretty hard over the last couple of years to have missed the [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). These great little single board computers were released in early 2012 with the aim of promoting computer science skills in schools.

I wonder if the designers had any idea how popular it woudl all becomes, and how many adults would turn gooey eyed over the little devices. I went on the waiting list pretty early on, as I wanted a platform on which I could learn Linux, without the hassle of organising a dual boot on my only laptop.

This was the start of the gooey eyedness, and I now have four raspberry pis doing different things in different places. In this post, I'm going to describe a simple system to 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
