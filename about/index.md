I'm an environmental scientist with a background in forest and agricultural research, and a penchant for statistics, R, and latterly machine learning. I'm also big into [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) and tree climbing, and blog about them on occasion too. 

I'm currently working to move my blog away from blogspot, but you can read the original posts [here](http://ivyleavedtoadflax.blogspot.co.uk/).
